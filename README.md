Differentiator is a simple program that uses the sympy library for symbolic differentiation. The code calculates deriveratives of complex functions. The code will also parse any given function and fed it into the symbolic differentiator to return a result. Multivariable calculus (partial deivatives) are also supported through symbolic differentiation.
