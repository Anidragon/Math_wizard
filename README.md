various programs for mathematics through computing

#1:
Differentiator is a simple program that uses the sympy library for symbolic differentiation. The code calculates deriveratives of complex functions. The code will also parse any given function and feed it into the symbolic differentiator to return a result. Multivariable calculus (partial derivation) is also supported through symbolic differentiation.

#2:
Differentiator is a simple program that uses the sympy library for symbolic integration. The code calculates integrals of complex functions. The code will also parse any given function and feed it into the symbolic integrator to return a result. Multivariable calculus (partial integrals with respect to any number of variables) is also supported through symbolic Integration.
